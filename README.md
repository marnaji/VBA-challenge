# VBA-challenge

## Project description 
In this project I will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 

I Created a script that can loop through the stock data and will output changes through years, percent of the changes, total volume and ticker symbol. The data include few worksheets and each worksheets represent information related to a different year.  
VBA script has been used to run on every worksheet for each year and do some calculation to return out come on specific collumn. 

I used VBA scripting to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

The yearly change collumn has been modified by conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
Bellow is the image of the outcome:
