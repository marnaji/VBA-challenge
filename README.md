# VBA-challenge

## Project description 
In this project I will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 

I Created a script that can loop through the stock data and will output changes through years, percent of the changes, total volume and ticker symbol. The data that has been provided to me is includes few years. Each year has related data in a different sheet so I made sure the script has been enabled to run on all worksheets at the same time. 
 I used VBA scripting to calculate the greates percentage increase, and decrase. Last but not the least I calculated the greatest total volum 

the outcome provided the output as this image:

![Alt text](."Title")
